**Phase-1 & Phase-2:**
Contains programs and coding problems we had solved using C Programming during the CRT training. I hope these programs are helpful to anyone who are trying to learn C PROGRAMMING along with DATA STRUCTURES.

Contains basic problems we can solve using C Language to improve our logical thinking ability and implementations of C Data Structures.

**Phase-3:**
It contains projects we did using MERN Stack including basic HTML,CSS projects.
